<h1>Psychic Goblins</h1>
<p>They are the most weird type of psychic mutants I have encountered so far.</p>

<p>
    Goblins pour black body radiation into their victim's back of the body and left side of the head.
     they would do it to anyone and everyone they see, as their end goal in life is to multiply
      and devour the whole world. I have confirmed it first hand that they are in contact with some entites
       in the Andromeda galaxy.
    <br/><br/>
    Goblins are not natural psychic mutants, they are contacted and in most cases initiated by someone and made a Goblin
     they use mainly smoke magic, dark magic and some time ago they also used black magic which is now becoming a thing of the past.
      they are obsessed with black color but wont show it to anyone. Their techniques are quite simple for an advanced malevolent teachings.
    <br/><br/>
    Goblins block and repell all and every magic and energy that they don't recognise and understand,
     they always keep track of all types of energy that manages to take down their defense system and understand it over a frequency.
    For them to be able to understand the attack, it has to have a pattern to it and has to be repeated more than once in a row.
    After analysing the pattern, they start prepairing the defence against it and try to block the pattern from approaching them
     and after that they would try to prevent the magic from being triggered again.
    To prevent the magic from triggering they try to block the flow of energy towards the spells,
     block the caster's chakra points or to alter the logical neural pathways of the magician.
    They try to block the speach related areas of the brain as much as possible and to try to tap into the magican's head they focus
     on the Temporal lobe and Occipital lobe to check what you are seeing. Try to close your eyes, if you feel a bit tensed up in the
      back of your head then it means you were being spied on. The spying mechanism feels like a stab in head where the tear gets created.
    <br/><br/>
    Goblins tend to use mostly vampires to achive their goals but, they also use other types of psychic mutants for various purposes.
    Goblin do this by using smoke magic to dull the vampiric senses and
     then send their servitor through the back of the vampire to control the mind of the vampire.
    The servitor then hides somewhere in either chest of the back near the spine to feed off of vampire and
     uses the vampiric tentecles to infect more and more people with smoke magic and feed off of them.
    Goblins prefer to hide till the end until the vampire has been drained completely and
     they have taken over the vampire's mind.
    They reveal themselve as the perpreatator to the vampire to instill fear into their mind
     and oppress them further so the vampire may loose hope of getting the control of their body back.
    At that point only an experienced psychic vampire or higher entites can free the vampire from Goblin influence.
    <br/><br/>
    Goblins only reveal themselve as the perpreatator only if there is a single vampire targated by many goblins so
     that no one can help the vampire but,
      if there are more vampires and even one of them is an adapt then they would show themselves as a sympatiser
       and a friend who wants to help them get stronger.
    <br/><br/>
    Goblins have the ability to control other mutants and take over their mind and they live in a hive mind.
    Everything a Goblin knows is shared with other goblins through the Andromeda collective zones
     and they try to take over any peice of energy that they can get their hands on.
    Unlike vampires, they have very poor understanding of different types of energies
     and can not distinguish between colorful energies,
      for them something is either black magic or white magic or shades of grey.
    Goblins are color blind to magic so they have to rely of vampiric ability to sense colorful magic
     and they are always short on vampires,
      this makes them feerful of red and blue energy magic which are two most colorful energies they can't detect on their own.
    Goblins can't digest active red, green and normal blue energies however they love passive red and both active and passive blue, green enegies.
    There are other energies in the human bodies that the Goblins are afraid of such as active Chi erergy and passive Ra energy.
<br/><br/>
    Goblins create dimentional tears in their victims to drain their energy,
     dimentional tears are common way to hurt someone in Left Hand Path and you don't have to be a psychic mutant to be able to use it.
    Dimentional tears create a small hole inside the victim's body.
    There are 2 sides of the hole, first is the pull side through which the victim is connected to a dark dimension
     and the pull side of the hole pulls dark energy from that dark dimension.
    The other side is the push side through which victim's energy escapes to where it connects (it usually connects to the perpreatator's body).
