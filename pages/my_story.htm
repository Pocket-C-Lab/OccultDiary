<h1>Chapter 1: Psychic Vampires</h1><br/>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	There are 3 kinds of vampires in the world,
	 Left Hand Practicioners (Snakes),
	  Right Hand Practicioners (Eagles) and we the bunnies.
	There was a time when I was a software developer,
	 I used to sit on a chair,
	  coding all day trying to come up with solutions in heat of the summer in a corner where Air Conditioner couldn't reach.
	Oh and yes, my boss was a psycic vampire and the worst; I didn't know I was one too.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>	
	Today I know better ways to protect myself from predators like him and if I had known these techniques,
 	 I wouldn't have left any of the jobs that I quit due to the same kind of problems. 
	My boss was an adapt of Left Hand Path. 
	He and his wife would cook up spells to try to bind me and he was so confident that he even let me go easily from the job,
	 thinking that I can't escape his magic;
	  he was wrong becase, even at that time I was already 5 years into Magic and Occut,
	   my favorite pass time was breaking hexes that would show up on the streets often;
	    his magic was no biggie for me, the problem was his apetite.
</p>

<h2>Bad Behaviour</h2>
<p>
	He would often stand behind me,
	 sniffing my head that would give me headaches and he would often give off a wicked smile after he had his meal out of me. 
	Programming was already a difficult and exhausting job and on top of it his Vampirism was makig me loose my mind and health. 
	I was a psychic vampire but I wasn't aware of it and that was making it more difficult,
	 I used to feel good after holding some garlic coves in my hand,
	  I didn't know that I was satiating myself from plants;
	   was in habit of touching grass and grabbing flowers in my house garden and college. 
	The small energy intakes from plants couldn't compete with his techniques of sucking the white light off of me that was my life force. 
	Now that I have taken my energy back from him and every vampire that took it from me,
	 I want to share what happened and how I dealt with it so you guys can learn from it.
	 <br/>
	<br/>1) Their basic tactic is to put all the blame on you,
	 to belittle you and call you a looser,
	  so you would never figure out that it was them all along.
	<br/>2) They try to make as much eye contact as possible and if you are wearing computer glasses;
	 then they panic and try to convince you that it's not good for your looks or health to wear blue cut glasses.
	<br/>3) They try to win every argument as if their life depends upon it,
	 because if they loose even once then your perception of them might change and you might get a bit more confidence against them,
	  which is good for you and really bad for them.
	<br/>4) They smoke in a ritualistic way, as if it's a religious rite.
	<br/>5) They spend more time in washroom than an average person, they quickly rush to the bathroom when they feel anxious.
	<br/>6) Tapping feet and shaking legs rigirously is normal to them, they can't control it.
	<br/>7) They are in habit of touching other people's arms, chest and back. 
			 They keep trying to find ways to touch others.
	<br/>8) They seem to be able to read your mind and they often bring up topics that you were only thinking in your mind,
	         but they make you think that it was your idea to bring about the topic.
</p>

<h2>The Trial and Errors</h2>
<p>
	To break his vampiric techniques,
	 I treid to create several magical tools,
	  my biggest mistake was handig off the magical tool to him with which I used to focus myself while studing when he asked me to do so. 
	At that time I wasn't very clever,
	 I thought to myself "What could happend?" and it was one of the worst decisions of my life,
	  all the tools I used to create that time were based off of same base as the pen he asked from me for a second,
	   I didn't even understand when he took the pen and looked at it for a few seconds and then smiled at me.
	He had figured out how it works just by looking at it and after that none of my tools worked against him,
	 no matter how many I used or how different they were from the previous one, 
	  he would always use smoke magic to block them. 
	Once I quit my job from there after a whole year I had to completely switch my magic system to sigil based magic.
</p>

<h2>Seemingly a Friend</h2>
<p>
	While I was at the job, 
	 I had two colleges,
	  the first one was a muslim guy who had knowlege about occult; he wasn't upfront about it but I had a clue,
	   he told me that clenching the fist blocks off the psychic attacks,
	    he didn't tell me that you have to apply intension of clenching and breaking the servitor that the attacker was using to attack,
		 I had to learn it on my own the hard way. 
	Before completely moving onto sigil based magic,
	 I dabbled into islamic magic in which a dua was used to bind to a thread;
	  and the thread would be tied to an object that you have to carry as a talisman;
	   simple yet effective. 
	I wasn't a muslim so I created my own magic spells following the everyday Witch manual for creating spells and it worked flawlessly, 
	 until my boss brought another collegue who was even a bigger nusence than my boss.
	<br/>
	<br/>Points to note for creating a spell:-
	<br/>1) A magic spell should have a begining and an ending.
	<br/>2) I use the standard "As I will it" as the begining of the spell and end it with "So shall it be".
	<br/>3) Always use proper grammar, I used to think that magic is just will power and the desire to bring a change that makes it happen, 
	         I was so wrong, always pay attension to grammar;
			  english language and modern laguages were most likely made by occultists otherwise my spells couldn't have backfired.
			My intension is always clear but my spells have had some unexpected results due to bad grammar and formatting.
	<br/>4 Never use negative words if you don't know how to use them,
			a spell can only backfire if you use words like death in the wrong context.
		     Always be careful of negative words or don't use them at all.
	<br/>5 Use the word shall instead of should and would because shall make things happen.
		    The word die is more direct and powerful than death because death implies that something or someone who used to be alive is no more;
			 which slightly misses the action from the spell and the spell relies on other words for better context.
</p>

<h2>The bigger nuisance</h2>
<p>
	The new collegue breathed smoke magic on the back of my head the first day he came to the office.
	His breath was like acid to me, it was so acidic that I thought he had some kind of serious medical condition. 
	He always used to pat his feet like a drummer would in death metal concert. He seemed upset by my presence there,
	 later I found out that all vampires do this.
	I didn't do it initially but after an year in my next company where I was surrounded by thousands of psychic vampires and psychic goblins,
	 even I started doing the foot thumping unintensionally. 
	This is due to the feeling like a sand like substance is coursing through the body and your hands start reaching to your back without even you being aware of it.
	There were some things very disturbing about him. He was more troubled at the job than the fresher that the partner comapny hired,
	 the fresher was very intelligent and could solve problems within minutes,
	  after a few days she started loosing her mind and she quit within a month of joining and he started to improve,
	   everyone started to remain sick for days after the new recruit quit the job,
	    it became harder for me to even focus and even to this day I'm still recovering.
</p>
<p>
	It is believed that Noth and East of every country are the hub of Left Hand Path practicioners;
	 and West and South and considered strong holds of Right Hand Path,
	  he was from the East and clearly had a lot more experiance than my boss,
	   because of him I felt like I had no choice but to leave the company,
	    but I couldn't muster up the courage to do so for months due to my family and financial problems.
</p>

<h2>The New Begining</h2>
<p>
	Once I quit my job after convincing my family,
	 my boss didn't even take it seriously,
	  he must have thought that his magic could bring me back to him,
	   begging to take me back to the hell I crawled out of.
	I wasn't going back in any condition so I made a compromise with my carrer,
	 I switched to Customer Analyst job and left my Programming carrer right there and then.
	  After joining the new work place,
	   it seemed like I had come to heaven,
	    even tho everyone else was complaining about the company culture and work place not havign enough facilities.
	It seemed like heaven for 2 days straight until I had to deal with a psychic goblin in my batch,
	 it was worse than the adapt collegue as he was using techniques I had never dealt with before.
	<br/> 
	<br/>I will write about it in my next post.
