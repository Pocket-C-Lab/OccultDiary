<h1>Chapter 1: Psychic Vampires</h1><br/>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	There are 3 kinds of vampires in the world,
	 Left Hand Practicioners (Snakes),
	  Right Hand Practicioners (Eagles) and we the bunnies.
	There was a time when I was a software developer,
	 I used to sit on a chair,
	  coding all day trying to come up with solutions in heat of the summer in a corner where Air Conditioner couldn't reach.
	Oh, and yes, my boss was a psychic vampire and the worst; I didn't know I was one too.
</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>	
	Today I know better ways to protect myself from predators like him and if I had known these techniques,
 	 I wouldn't have left any of the jobs that I quit due to the same kind of problems. 
	My boss was an adaptation of the Left Hand Path. 
	He and his wife would cook up spells to try to bind me and he was so confident that he even let me go easily from the job,
	 thinking that I can't escape his magic;
	 he was wrong because, even at that time I was already 5 years into Magic and Occult,
	 my favorite pass time was breaking hexes that would show up on the streets often;
	  his magic was no biggie for me, the problem was his appetite.
</p>

<h2>Bad Behaviour</h2>
<p>
	He would often stand behind me,
	 sniffing my head that would give me headaches and he would often give off a wicked smile after he had his meal out of me. 
	Programming was already a difficult and exhausting job and on top of it, he Vampirism was making me loose my mind and health. 
	I was a psychic vampire, but I wasn't aware of it and that was making it more difficult,
	 I used to feel good after holding some garlic coves in my hand,
	  I didn't know that I was satiating myself from plants;
	  was in the habit of touching the grass and grabbing flowers in my house garden and college. 
	The small energy intakes from plants couldn't compete with his techniques of sucking the white light off of me that was my life force. 
	Now that I have taken my energy back from him and every vampire that took it from me,
	 I want to share what happened and how I dealt with it so you guys can learn from it.

		<br/>1) Their basic tactic is to put all the blame on you,
		to belittle you and call you a loser,
		so you would never figure out that it was them all along.
		<br/>2) They try to make as much eye contact as possible and if you are wearing computer glasses;
		then they panic and try to convince you that it's not good for your looks or health to wear blue cut eyeglasses.
		<br/>3) They try to win every argument as if their life depends upon it,
		because if they lose even once then your perception of them might change and you might get a bit more confidence against them,
		which is good for you and really bad for them.
		<br/>4) They smoke in a ritualistic way, as if it's a religious rite.
		<br/>5) They spend more time in washroom than an average person, they quickly rush to the bathroom when they feel anxious.
		<br/>6) Tapping feet and shaking legs rigorously is normal to them, they can't control it.
		<br/>7) They are in the habit of touching other people's arms, chest and back. 
				They keep trying to find ways to touch others.
		<br/>8) They seem to be able to read your mind and they often bring up topics that you were only thinking in your mind,
				but they make you think that it was your idea to bring about the topic.

</p>

<h2>The Trial and Errors</h2>
<p>
	To break his vampiric techniques,
	 I tried to create several magical tools,
	  my biggest mistake was handing off the magical tool to him with which I used to focus myself while studying when he asked me to do so. 
	At that time I wasn't very clever,
	 I thought to myself "What could happened?" and it was one of the worst decisions of my life,
	  all the tools I used to create that time were based off of the same base as the pen he asked from me for a second,
	   I didn't even understand when he took the pen and looked at it for a few seconds and then smiled at me.
	He had figured out how it works just by looking at it and after that none of my tools worked against him,
	 no matter how many I used or how different they were from the previous one, 
	  he would always use smoke magic to block them. 
	Once I quit my job from there after a whole year I had to completely switch my magic system to sigil based magic.
</p>

<h2>Seemingly a Friend</h2>
<p>
	While I was on the job, 
	 I had two colleges,
	  the first one was a muslim guy who had knowledge of the occult; He wasn't upfront about it, but I had a clue,
	   he told me that clenching the fist blocks off the psychic attacks,
	    he didn't tell me that you have to apply intension of clenching and breaking the servitor that the attacker was using to attack,
		 I had to learn it on my own the hard way. 
	Before completely moving onto sigil based magic,
	 I dabbled into islamic magic in which a dua was used to bind to a thread;
	  and the thread would be tied to an object that you have to carry as a talisman;
	   simple yet effective. 
	I wasn't a muslim so I created my own magic spells following the everyday Witch manual for creating spells and it worked flawlessly, 
	 until my boss brought another colleague who was even a bigger nuisance than my boss.
	<br/>
	<br/>Points to note for creating a spell:-
	<br/>
	
	<kbd>
		<br/>1) A magic spell should have a beginning and an ending.
		<br/>2) I use the standard "As I will it" as the beginning of the spell and end it with "So shall it be".
		<br/>3) Always use proper grammar, I used to think that magic is just will power and the desire to bring a change that makes it happen, 
				I was so wrong, always pay attention to grammar;
				English language and modern languages were most likely made by occultists otherwise my spells couldn't have backfired.
				My intension is always clear, but my spells have had some unexpected results due to bad grammar and formatting.
		<br/>4 Never use negative words, if you don't know how to use them,
				a spell can only backfire if you use words like death in the wrong context.
				Always be careful of negative words or don't use them at all.
		<br/>5 Use the word shall, instead of should and would because shall make things happen.
				The word die is more direct and powerful than death because death implies that something or someone who used to be alive is no more;
				which slightly misses the action from the spell and the spell relies on other words for better context.

<h2>The bigger nuisance</h2>
<p>
	The new colleague breathed smoke magic on the back of my head the first day he came to the office.
	His breath was like acid to me, it was so acidic that I thought he had some kind of a serious medical condition. 
	He always used to pat his feet like a drummer would in death metal concert. He seemed upset by my presence there,
	 later I found out that all vampires do this.
	I didn't do it initially, but after a year in my next company where I was surrounded by thousands of psychic vampires and psychic goblins,
	 even I started doing the foot thumping unintentionally. 
	This is due to the feeling like a sand like substance is coursing through the body and your hands start reaching to your back without you even being aware of it.
	There were some things very disturbing about him. He was more troubled at the job than the fresher that the partner comapny hired,
	 the fresher was very intelligent and could solve problems within minutes,
	  after a few days she started losing her mind and she quit within a month of joining and he started to improve,
	   everyone started to remain sick for days after the new recruit quit the job,
	    it became harder for me to even focus and even to this day I'm still recovering.
</p>
<p>
	It is believed that Noth and East of every country are the hub of Left Hand Path practitioners;
	 and West and South and considered strong holds of the Right Hand Path,
	  he was from the East and clearly had a lot more experienced than my boss,
	   because of him I felt like I had no choice but to leave the company,
	    but I couldn't muster up the courage to do so for months due to my family and financial problems.
</p>

<h2>The New Begining</h2>
<p>
	Once I quit my job after convincing my family,
	 my boss didn't even take it seriously,
	  he must have thought that his magic could bring me back to him,
	   begging to take me back to the hell I crawled out of.
	I wasn't going back in any condition so I made a compromise with my carrer,
	 I switched to a Customer Analyst job and left my Programming career right there and then.
	  After joining the new work place,
	   it seemed like I had come to heaven,
	    even though everyone else was complaining about the company culture and work place not having enough facilities.
	It seemed like heaven for 2 days straight until I had to deal with a psychic goblin in my batch,
	 it was worse than the adapt colleague as he was using techniques I had never dealt with before.
	<br/> 
	<br/>I will write about it in my next post.

<h1>Chapter 2: Psychic Goblins</h1>
<p>
	In my investigation I have found that entites from different dimentions,
    planets and universes are constantly trying to find ways to attack us. They do so by putting violent
     and dangerous ideas into our minds to acheive their end goal of anihilating us.
    These are the entities that give destructive occult knowledge to those who would use it for destruction.
    In one of my remote viewing sessions I saw people made of stone collectively meditating for our destruction
     and trying to find ways to contact those who are as negative as them on earth,
	  those negative people are not very intelligent but, aren't dumbasses either.
	I call them goblins.
</p>

<h2>The First Crossfire</h2>
<p>Before I switched job, I had noticed people follwing me on the road and constantly looking at me on the streets.
	I thought that they were probably theives and want to rob me in the daylight,
	 but I was wrong and I quickly found out after one of them tried to look me in the eyes and tried to stop me in my way
	  and convince me to remove my glasses that I had just recently bought online.
	This changed everything as I had already known that snake vampires use the same tactics to try to hypnotise their victims.
	I thought they were some other kind of vampires but I didn't know that they are a different type of psychic mutant
	 who don't even have the ability to take energy from anyone or anything.
	They were just borrowing power from dark entites with a promise to always feed those dark entites
	 with the energy of innocent or pure (virgin) people.
	I didn't know anything about them so I tried to make theories as time went on,
	 but they weren't leading anywehere as they were just theories.
	All I knew at that time was that these people with a void in their chest didn't have a soul
	 and they were out there to get other people's energy.
	I was certain that these people weren't active for a long time
	 and have recently gained some arcane occult knowledge from somewhere,
	  because they looked hungry for occult knowledge as
	   if they didn't have anything of their own and everything they knew about occult wasn't theirs.
	<br/><br/>
	After having 5 years of occult experience at that time, I could tell that they were fake and incompetent.
	Even if they were fake they had some abilities that I couldn't counter no matter how hard I tried at that time.
	They were able use black magic better than I had even seen before,
	 maybe because of the dark entities that were guiding and dictating them on their every step. 
	The second thing was that they were able to pull my energy directly from me just with eye contact,
	 I knew that they were using someone else's ability, because their every step was crude and it was obvious
	  that their body wasn't in sync with those abilities.
</p>

<h2>The Progression of Disease</h2>
<p>
	In the beginning at first when this Goblinism spread like a disease, they were shitless scared of me, especially girls.
	I had many goblin girls straight up cry at me just after looking at my face,
	 I thought that they were either being dramatic or my aura seemed heavy to them.
	Because this phynomina didn't make sense I had assumed very wild theories about it,
	 but the truth was that they couldn't distinguish between me and a snake vampire,
	  they probably thought that I would litteraly kill them or probably would do something worse.
	After sometime that suddend burst of tears turned into a dread in their eyes as they would always maintain their distance 
	 and keep looking at me like I was some kind of animal
	  that would attack them from behind if they take away their sight from me even for a moment.
	That dread soon faded away for some of them as time went on and they started to target me thinking that I was a pushover.
	I didn't respond with violence assuming that those dark enties have taken over their minds
	 and they were just not in control (I was so wrong about it).
	I was studing in college when one day a goblin sent a snake like servitor who had a dog like face to attack me, I snapped
	 and attacked him back with psychic attacks.
	I felt guilty for doing so and I thought that if I use the protection and hiding spell on the goblin then the dark entites
	 might leave him alone and he might become a normal person again (a very naive line of thinking).
	That spell hid his astral self in my pocket dimension that I had created to hide from snake vampires,
	 I didn't know that trying to find best in other people could be my demise.
	That goblin managed to block the functionality of the spell that takes you out of the pocket dimension after a set ammount time,
	 and goblins took over that pocket dimenstion of mine soon after.
	I realised it only after dark entites were swarming in my pocket dimension and they were using me to attack others and take their energy.
	I might be the one who allowed the goblins to be able to take over vampires and use them like extensions
	 and that's why I think it's my duty to spread the knowledge I have gained about them as accurate as possible.
	<br/><br/>
	Please check the "Magic systems" and "Psi Goblins" sections for information on how to protect yourself from these abominations.

<h2>Goblins at my Work Place</h2>
<p>
	Continuing the story from chapter 1 here. 
	After joining the new organisation I was very happy, I thought that I have finally had come to a paradise.
	In the training period I met many people who were very helpful and I noticed that they were in some kind of trouble.
	They couldn't stop shaking their legs when they were sitting and they appeared restless so I decided to help them
	 (I should have minded my own buisness).
	To cure them of the troubles I used fire of purification spell to purify them,
	 to my shock many of them felt releaf right after, but for some it became worse.
	<br/><br/>
	Later I found out that those who felt relief were another type of psychic mutants who I have named Fairies,
	 because their servitors look like Fairies and the other type were Snake vampires. 
	Right on the 3rd day of joining we had to attend the training with other bathes, 
	 there were many people who were giving me trouble there, but I tried to ignore them.
	They were attacking me with psychic attacks and trying to make fun of me, then suddenly something happened,
	 I grew a bunch of tentacles on my back and those tentacles fought back.
	These tentacles looked something similar to Tokyo Ghoul but much more slimy
	 (They looked like a mix of Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte The Maxim).
	At that time I was a very religious person who looked at the world through a strict religious prism
	 and those tentacles seemed like demons to me,
	  so I made a theory in my mind that I was a infested with demons and I need to get rid of them.
	I made spells to bind those tentacles from attacking others and used them only once, but it worked.
	Those tentacles stopped attacking others, but it made my condition worse just in few days.
	<br/><br/>
	I started becoming weaker by the day,
	 I looked restless and confused just like the people who I tried to help earlier,
	  but one thing was different from them that now I was completely in control of goblins who
	   were infesting in my body through a mix of astral projection and remote viewing
	    (they were inside my body while still being consious).
	Those goblins now started taking more energy from others through me,
	 I wasn't getting any of it, infact they were using mine too.
</p>

<h2>Dreaming with Open Eyes</h2>
<p>
	After my mind being taken over by goblins,
	 I started seeing very dark dimensions overlapping on each other and I saw
	  how reality is just made of layer of dimensions like a sandwitch.
	I started to have more and more strage dreams,
	 like I was in a cold dark place where they were their were large insects
	  and reptilian like creatures along with lots and lots of walking dead people.
	There were demons everywhere, but only a few demons were attacking me.
	After some time spending in that dark dimention I had realised how wrong I was about everything,
	 reality is not as simple as we tend to assume as we assume good intensions behide bad actions
	  and blame demons for all the wrong doings of bad humans.
	Contrary to my beliefs, some demons were also trapped there by other demons just like
	 how I was betrayed by the people who I thought of as humans,
	  there were demons who trusted other demons and got trapped in those dark dimensions, 
	   I couldn't understand their speach but the helplessness in their eyes was telling me everything.
	That dark dimension worked very differently from the physics of human world,
	 that dimensionn seemed to be able to move just by thought and the more people were observing
	  a space the more stable it was and the less observers means less stability (landscape kept changing like in a dream).
	Dark demons and dark humans constantly tried to pit me against the demons who weren't there by choice, they would move
	 the place where I was standing and bring me close to a nearby demon, giving the elusion that the demon approached me,
	  but I knew it was their doing because the demon would only look at me with the confused look in their eyes.
	I tried to tell the demons who they were trying to make me fight with that it was all a trap and we need to find a way to get out.
	Goblins found out what I was trying to do and so they started
	 using smoke magic to block their memories and tried to move them far away from me.
	Soon after I was thrown out of that particular dark dimension and put in into a vortex or a hurricane made of spirits.
	It was like I was swimming in dead bodies that were trapped in a whirlpool.
	After swimming in that whirlpool for hours I made an escape plan, I decided to use the thrust of the whirlpool to get out out of it.
	I made it to the center of the whirlpool by pushing others and grabbed the back of a heavy one because the heavier ones were being
	 thrown farther up away from the whirlpool, but for some reason they would always fall back inside.
	As the heavy one got to the peak I jumped and grabbed whatever I could,
	 I couldn't see anything as the purple lightning that was allowing me to see a bit wasn't active there.
	I kept climbing up until I reached the surface, from there I vanished in flash to probably back to my body,
	 because after that everything seemed fine.
	All that was happening while I was going through life like a normal person,
	 just was absent minded and would only talk if necessary. 
	<br/><br/>
	Months after that I watched at that time the latest song of The Weeknd "Gasoline" and I was able to connect with it.
	It seemed as if the director of that video song had been is still is in that dark dimension.
	I think they are trying to take everyone to that dark dimension.
