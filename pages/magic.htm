<h1>Magic System 1</h1>

<p>
	First spells I made to defend myself from vampirism were very simple.
    They were written in 3 parts for clear and effective results.
    <br/>
    <br/> * The spells were processed in 3 phases.<br/>
          The 1st one is Initialization phase where I properly define what I want from the spell and 
            the specific elements to be affected by the spell.
             (These elements should be strictly defined if they are other than you and are outside of your body).
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        As I will it, 
        I invoke intelligence, wisdom and fortitude for my cause.
    </kbd>
    <br/><br/> * The 2nd phase is where I define where exactly should the spell work and how it should work.
            I call it the compilation or logical phase.
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        Grant me appropriate line of thinking,
         that shall help me in my endevours and spare me the mistakes that might happen due to my ignorance,
          incompetence and greed.    
    </kbd>
    <br/><br/> * The 3rd phase is where I get the spell moving and that's why I call it the run phase.
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        Intelligence, wisdom and fortitude, come and settle in my head, work in my mind in a way that shall make me do better every day.
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>

    <br/>So, the complete spell would be
    <br/>:-
    <kbd>
        As I will it, 
        I invoke intelligence, wisdom and fortitude for my cause. <br/>

        Grant me appropriate line of thinking,
         that shall help me in my endevours and spare me the mistakes that might happen due to my ignorance,
          incompetence and greed. <br/>

        Intelligence, wisdom and fortitude, come and settle in my head, work in my mind in a way that shall make me do better every day.
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>

    <br/>The defence spell I used at that time was
    <br/>:-
    <kbd>
        As I will it,
        My brain is locked and sealed. <br/>
        I'm invisible to my enemies. <br/>
        My speach is encrypted so no one can listen to my thoughts on any plane. <br/>
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>
</p>

<h1>Vampiric Magic system</h1>

<p>The spells above did help me a lot but they weren't as effective against Snakes, as the snake vampires have different ways to go around someone's defense.
    Any non Snake vampire would be able to take energy from an open system through their focus alone and from a closed system through the touch.
     A vampire's mastery over energy is unparalled and a Snake vampire who is habitual of taking energy from closed system through focus,
      with the help of black body radiation and other methods would not care for flimsy defence and would continue to drain you unless you have solid,
       5 or more layers of defence sheild that's strong enough to hold it's own.
    <br/>
    As a bunny vampire it was very hard for me to defend myself from Sanke vampires as 
     they use tentecle like demons to peirce your charkra points to drain your energy.
      the tentacles are very normal for psychic mutants. 
    Every psychic mutant can form and extend tentacles in the astral world except goblins.
    <br/><br/>
    The five layer defence against the psychic vampires is :-
    <kbd>
        <br/>1) Make a parameter of attack and defence so that you can sense the tentacles when they are approaching.
        <br/>2) Use 5 sigils as your sheild to defend your self from the attacks.
        <br/>3) Use 5 sigils to attack as offesive defence.
        <br/>4) Use peices of 8 sigils to bind the servitors of the snake vampire that's attacking you.
        <br/>5) Use 5 sigils to heal yourself from the damage that the vampire has caused so your senses won't get tired or give up.
    </kbd>

<h1>Goblin Magic system</h1>

<p>
    Goblins are not natural psychic mutants, being a psychic and a psychic mutant means different things.
    A psychic can use their natural psychic talent such as remote viewing
     and telepathy but in the capacity of an average human being.
    A psychic mutant has a differently working psychic abilities that might give
     them certain advantages and disadvantages over normal humans.
    Psychic goblins are not naturally born mutants,
     they are given psychic mutations by horrifying worm like creatures
      that look like something straight out of H.P Lovecraft novels.

    The goblins use smoke magic, dark magic (recently) and black magic (traditionally).
    The use of smoke magic was most likely inspired from the vodun religion as they use smoke in religious rites
     and some entities can move the smoke through dimentions to achive specific results.
    Smoke can be used to jam a person's chakra system,
     cause damage to electronic devices and much more.
    Smoke magic is only as powerful as it's applications,
     if you don't know how to handle it or don't have enough servitors to carry it around then it could backfire.
    <br/><br/>Smoke magic can be removed and treated through the following procedure :-
    <br/>
    <kbd>
    <br/>* Imagine that you are pulling the black smoke out of your body and relieasing it in the atmosphere.
    <br/>* Now imagine a pink light entering your body and coursing through your veins and nerves.
    <br/>* Now imagine pink light covering your body from head to toe, seeping into your body and merging with it.
    <br/>* Now imagine that pink light mixing into the white light in your body and makig it dark pink. 
    <br/>* Now imagine and believe that you have become a being of pink light and now you emit and absorb pink energy naturally.
    </kbd>
    <br/>
    This would be enough to make sure that smoke magic won't work on you for a long time or might never work on you ever again.
    <br/><br/>
    Dark magic is something that they have gained knowledge about recently through the research on dark energy.
    It's mainly used to bind someone's time and space just enough that they would start to notice that time is passing by
     them very fast but to other people it seems as if they are just very slow at everything.
    Goblins use time magic to stop time around them like a frame in a movie where no one moves,
     then they use their servitors to stay at the position where they were looking
      the servitors then can be used to directly attack the person at any given time when they want to hurt any person
       as time is relative and the other person would feel the pain in their present, of the wound inflicted in the past.
    To avoid creating a new timeline,
     the goblin just uses that specific frame of space time and black magic to cause misery to the other person.
    Dark magic can be very dangerous and can create many para-dimensions all at once,
     althogh goblins do not like to use dark energy without the conjucture of black magic,
      they often loose control of dark energy when they have been attacked successfully and repeatedly.
    Once they loose control of dark energy it creates many para-dimensions
     and with each para dimention it breakes them into many as if it creates their clones.
    Every para-dimension is darker than the previous one and at the end they stop existing as a single entity
     and all that's left inside them is complete darkness.
    <br/><br/>Dark magic can be removed and treated through the following procedure :-
    <br/>
    <kbd>
    <br/>* Imagine that all the darkness inside of you is compressing and converting into high frequency white body radiation non-stop.
    <br/>* Now imagine that white body radiation to come thogether and form into white light in a continueity.
    <br/>* Now imagine that white light forming into a think white liquid, spreading into your body and merging with it continuesly.
    <br/>* Now imagine that white liquid to become consious and working to evolve you as a being of white light as it is becoming a liquid. 
    <br/>* Now you will start seeing other beings of white light.
    </kbd>
    <br/><br/>
    This would be enough to make sure that Dark magic won't work on you for a some time.
    <br/><br/>

    For understanding Goblin black magic, I would advise you to go and read Akhkharu-Vampyre Magick book that's easily available online.
    This book claims to be teaching you on how to become a psychic vampire altho it's just a failed attempt by
     the Andromeda galaxy perpreatators to use and abuse naive people who would genuinly belive
      that this book teaches you on how to become a psychic vampire.
    This book claims to be satanic but shows the techniques that indian goblins have been using for centuries.
     This book shows depictions of vampires with long teeth but doesn't tell you that pisacha (indian vampires) don't have teeth.
      Pisacha look like goblins from western folklore so I desided to use the word goblin for them.
    <br/><br/>

    To remove black magic, salt baths and grounding are adviced athogh it would be better if you go and seek help from a professional.
