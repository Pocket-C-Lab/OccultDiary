<h1>Magic System 1</h1>

<p>
	First spells I made to defend myself from vampirism were very simple.
    They were written in 3 parts for clear and effective results.
    <br/>
    <br/> * The spells were processed in 3 phases.<br/>
          The 1st one is Initialization phase where I properly define what I want from the spell and 
            the specific elements to be affected by the spell.
             (These elements should be strictly defined if they are other than you and are outside of your body).
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        As I will it, 
        I invoke intelligence, wisdom and fortitude for my cause.
    </kbd>
    <br/><br/> * The 2nd phase is where I define where exactly should the spell work and how it should work.
            I call it the compilation or logical phase.
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        Grant me appropriate line of thinking,
         that shall help me in my endevours and spare me the mistakes that might happen due to my ignorance,
          incompetence and greed.    
    </kbd>
    <br/><br/> * The 3rd phase is where I get the spell moving and that's why I call it the run phase.
    <br/>Ex:-
    <kbd style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        Come and settle in my head, work in my mind in a way and make me do better every day.
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>

    <br/>So, the complete spell would be:-
    <br/>
    <kbd>
        As I will it, 
        I invoke intelligence, wisdom and fortitude for my cause. <br/>

        Grant me appropriate line of thinking,
         that shall help me in my endevours and spare me the mistakes that might happen due to my ignorance,
          incompetence and greed. <br/>

        Come and settle in my head, work in my mind in a way that shall make me do better every day.
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>

    <br/>The defence spell I used at that time was:-
    <br/>
    <kbd>
        As I will it,
        My brain is locked and sealed,
        I'm invisible to my enemies and,
        my speach is increpted so no one can listen to my thoughts on any plane.
        So shall it be.
    </kbd>

<h1>Vampiric Magic system</h1>

<p>The spells above did help me a lot but they were't as effective against Snakes as they have different ways to go around someone's defense.
    Any non Snake vampire would be able to take energy from an open system through their focus alone and from a closed system through the touch.
     A vampire's mastery over energy is unparalled and a Snake vampire who is habitual of taking energy from closed system through focus,
      with the help of black body radiation and other methods would not care for flimsy defence and would continue to drain you unless you have solid,
       5 or more layers of defence sheild that's strong enough to hold it's own.

    As a bunny vampire it was very hard for me to defend my self from Sanke vampires as 
     they use tentecle like demons to peirce your charkra points to drain your energy.
      the tentecles are very normal for any psychic mutant but it's not viable for goblins.
</p>

<h1>Goblin Magic system</h1>

<p>
    
    Goblins pour black body radiation into their victim's back and left side of the head.
     they would do it to anyone and everyone they see, as their end goal in life is to multiply
      and devour the whole world. I have confirmed it that they are in contact with some entites
       in the Andromeda galaxy. In my investigation I have found that entites from different dimentions,
        planets and universes are constantly trying to find ways to attack us. They do so by putting violent
         and dangerous ideas into our minds to acheive their end goal of anihilating us. In one of my remote viewing
          sessions I saw people made of stone collectively meditating for our destruction and trying to find ways to 
           contact those who are as negative as them. These are the entities that give destructive occult knowledge to those
            who would use it for destruction.

    Goblins are not natural psychic mutants, they are contacted and in most cases initiated by someone and made a Goblin
     they use mainly smoke magic, dark magic and some time ago they also used black magic which is now becoming a thing of the past.
      they are obsessed with black color but wont show it to anyone. Their techniques are quite simple for an advanced malevelent teachings.
    
    Goblins block and repell all and every magic and energy that they don't recognise and understand,
     they always keep track of all types of energy that manages to take down their defense system and understand it over a frequency.
    For them to be able to understand the attack, it has to have a pattern to it and has to be repeated more than once in a row.
    After analysing the pattern, they start prepairing the defence against it and try to block the pattern from approaching them
     and after that they would try to prevent the magic from being triggered again.
    To prevent the magic from triggering they try
     to block the flow of energy towards the spells, block the caster's chakra points or to alter the logical neural pathways of
      the magician.
    They try to block the speach related areas of the brain as much as possible and to try to tap into the magican's head they focus
     on the Temporal lobe and Occipital lobe to check what you are seeing. Try to close your eyes, if you feel a bit tensed up in the
      back of your head then it means you were being spied on. The spying mechanism feels like a stab in head where the tear gets created.
