<h1>Psychic Vampires</h1>
<p>
	There are 3 types of vampires. Eagles, Snakes and Bunnies.<br/><br/>
	Eagles are those who get energy provided by God forms,
	 Egregores or some higher dimensions filled with the kind of energy that normal humans don't produce and can't digest.
	Snakes are those who take energy from other people to satiate themself and get stronger,
	 with time they get addicted to it and they need to take more of it to remain stable.
	Bunnies are those who take energy in small ammounts from plans, grass,
	 trees and sometimes excess energy from their atmosphere.
	This guide is for bunnies only because in most cases they don't even know they are a psycic vampire and
	 can't do anything to defend themself from predetory mutants and Left Hand practicioners.
	Eagles are in most cases protected by the God forms and Egregores that provide for them,
	 Snakes use Vampiric servitors to defend themself and attack others so
	  I don't think there's any chance a Snake would want to follow the vegan path I'm showing here for psychic mutants.
</p>

<h2>Basic Understanding</h2>
<p>
	Life for us Bunnies is very simple,
	 we live a happy go luck life when there's green grass to rub our hands on and no predetory mutants around,
	  but once there are goblins, snakes, etc around, we start feeling nausia and weakness in bones right from the start.
	As life goes on with our predetors, these things become normal and we get used to it.
	Accomplishing something in life becomes a faded dream, 
	 once a happy bunny now becomes a depressed emo who can't even socialize properly and have constant urge to do something, 
	  something that they don't even know or understand but have a feeling that it needs to be done.
</p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>
<p>
	The most important thing we need to understand is that we are not weak, just because we like to be happy and create happiness,
	 to love and be loved, be caring and being cared for, it doesn't mean we have to be the easy target.
	<br/><br/> To become strong, first I needed to acknowledge my weaknesses.
	It's true that I don't have a God form actively protecting me from all kinds of attacks so
	 I needed to make sure that I build my own psycic fence.
	The kind of fence that would let me know when I have been attacked otherwise,
	 I would suddenly get taken down again and again like every single time when I tried to defend myslef.
	<br/><br/>Second, I needed to switch to a better source of energy than grass,
	 magic takes energy and the kind of energy you feed your magic determines the outcome.
	There are only 7 types of basic enegies that human body generates through the chakras,
	 these energies take different forms in different dimensions. A psyicic vampire doesn't generate red,
	  green and blue enegies the same way a human does.
	Our Ajna chakra, Anahata chakra and Muladhara chakra don't work the same way a normal human' does.
	They have different purposes and are configured in a different way than an average human ones.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Chakra differences</h3>
<p>
	The Ajna chakra allows us to have control over energies and consciousness,
	 for better control the Ajna chkara of a psychic vampire generates less active blue/indigo enegies and more passive blue enegies.
	<br/><br/>The Anahata chakra allows us to feel energies and emotions and
	 psychic vampires can sense enegies from far away when trained properly,
	  to create space for new enegy to enter,
	   the body of a psyicic vampire creates those enegies less that it wants to sense more.
	<br/><br/>The Muladhara chakra is always active, it's the life source for our body and if compromised, can cause severe health problems.
	To make the body stronger, a psyicic vampire's body tries to consume and exract as much red enegry as possible,
	 but the enegy it needs is the active red energy and the energy an average human body generates is passive red enegy,
	  due to this the Svadhisthana chakra works as a converter of red enegy so
	   that the passive red energy remains stored in the body and gets used only when needed.
</p>

<h2>Switch to sigils</h2>
<p>
	Part of the problem is that we rely on very basic energies to sustain ourself which the Snakes expect us to be having.
	<br/>A slight change in apetite can make a huge difference in the attitude of those who treat us like feed.
	For starters I started feeding off of basic power sigils because Snakes fear powerful energy,
	 they like to prey on the weak and don't want to mess with the wrong people.
	<br/>The most obvious choice among power sigils is bismuth. <br/>
	It's the kind of sigil that can get you started on any task instantly once you adjust yourself to it,
	 it gives off hard energy that Snakes consider a threat to their existance.
	Unlike grass, sigils never get depleeted of energy,
	 it's like they operate on a level where energy starts to take form and everything begins to exist.
</p>

<h2>Sigils that will feed you.</h2>
<p>
	A psychic vampire can take energy from sigils any way they want,
	 but knowing the correct sigils for correct chakras can help them sustain for longer periods of time and remain healthy.
	<br/>
	I have chosen best sigils that worked for certain chakras better than other and I'm listing them below in order.
	<br/> 
	Draw these sigils on a peice of wood from top to bottom so you can keep them in your pocket safely.

<p>
	After drawing the sigils on the wood, invoke them one by one by their name.
	This way each sigil gets activated and they start working on the chakras.
